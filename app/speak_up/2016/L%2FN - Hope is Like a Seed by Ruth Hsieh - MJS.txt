Hope to me is like a seed in a potted plant. It starts with a seed, and then the rain comes down showering the seed with life-giving water. After that, the sun comes out to nurture the sprouting plant with vitamins for photosynthesis. The sunâ€™s radiance penetrates the soil to give vitamins and minerals so that the plant can produce marvelous fruits, vegetables and beautiful botanical flowers.
