[street writer] [currently homeless?]

Give me the strength 
To fight this affliction.

Give me the strength 
To beat this addiction.

Give me the strength 
To carry on.

Give me the strength 
When my strength is gone.

Give me the might
To get through this low tide.

Give me the might
To get on with my life.

Give me the power 
To fight off all foes.

Give me the power
When my power goes.

Give me the power 
To do what you would do.

Give me the power 
To tell all that is true.
