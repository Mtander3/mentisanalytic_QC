Interview with Edward Smalls
Interview by Bill Shaw


Where are you from originally?

I grew up in the country in a little town called Ravenel, twenty miles south of Charleston, SC. All my family is still there. It was all right. We weren’t rich enough. I grew up for awhile with just my mother and brother and sisters.

Why did you leave the Charleston area?

I left when my son got killed. They lured him into a back street and shot him three times in the chest. No idea why. I couldn’t give the slightest reason why someone would have killed him.

What’s your favorite memory of your son?

Just raising him, and growing up with him...the beach, fishing, crabbing. He was 36, not married. He had two kids. I still see my grandkids every time I go to Charleston. They are doing great.

What is the best memory you have from growing up?

I like to hunt and fish. I used to love to hunt and fish. Fish for any kind of fish that bite: catfish, mudfish, crappies, brims. I killed a lot of squirrels, raccoons, rabbits and deer. I had a bolt-action 12 gauge six shot. The gun would turn you upside down. I wasn’t very old, thirteen or fourteen years. You had to hold it all right. It would knock you down. 

Where are you living right now?

I am renting a room by the week in South Charlotte. The room is pretty nice, better than sleeping in a tent outside, I tell you that.

Where do you sell your magazines?

I am on the corner of North Tryon and 5th Street by Fifth Third Bank. I start work at 8 and work till five. Eight to five. It’s a job for me. 

Have you been homeless?

Yes. The reason is I had a federal offense which meant I couldn’t get a job or housing. I did my time, but there is no second chance. 

During this time of transition, what brings you comfort?

I think being on North Tryon and 5th Street, meeting the people. They are a great bunch of people.

Where do you see yourself in five years?

Working and living in my own place.
