Focus
By LaTonya M. Wilson

My focus is to remain strong in the faith of my God;
Focus

To continue to succeed in life with the ambition to stay on top;
Focus

On me as a mother, grandmother, Black woman;
Focus
 
On the little things, and they shall one day form large;
Focus

On the word of the Beholder, stay in tune where you are;
Focus

On the faith you walk with Him and not of men nor women;
Focus
