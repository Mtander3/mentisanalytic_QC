I Am Never Alone
Ray Feagles 

I am on a journey, but I am never alone.
My best friend walks beside me, and I do not walk alone.
When I grow weary of the road, I gain strength from my friend for I am never alone.
He is an example for me to follow. I learn from his ways. I am never alone.
His patience has no bounds. His happy nature gives me reason to smile.
He shows me how to relax. We have a bond that can only be broken by fate.
His love is unconditional. He truly loves me more than I love myself.
His name is Sargent Pepper, my four-footed friend until the end.
With my dog Pepper at my side, I am never alone.
