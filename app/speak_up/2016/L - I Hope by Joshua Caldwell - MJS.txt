I hope to find the right girl for me.

I hope to find a place to live and also to have roommates of my choosing.

I hope that I’ll go on a real vacation and have some real fun.

I hope that I’ll find a third job, so I can support myself and my friends.

I hope for happiness, joy, and peace for my life.

I hope for my family to live well.

I hope that the Carolina Panthers will win next year’s Super Bowl.

My hope is to stay alive and stay well.
