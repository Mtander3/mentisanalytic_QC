Sunshine
Ruth Hsieh

Sunshine has lots of vitamin D. It makes me healthier than ever. It penetrates my skin throughout and makes it feel so warm and soft to touch. That happy feeling just cannot be described. Sunshine brings everything to life. It rejuvenates my bodyâ€™s system, keeps my body organisms moving, and keeps the molecules flowing. I feel life released, endorphins in my brain, and it gives me a very good, satisfied feeling. It keep me energized and moving. 

Sunshine is one of the greatest gifts besides hope. I treasure and cherish it as one of the most valuable things in my life. It inspires in me a positive, outgoing perspective. 

The glow of the sunshine also brings my childhood memories back. When I feel alone, the sunshine still remains with me, flowing.
