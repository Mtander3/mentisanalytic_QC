Deep in a Hole 
by Sheila Apperson

Deep in a hole, there is this sadness 
breaking you apart into the madness. 
Life on the streets and all itâ€™s badness. 
Reflections of a life 
filled with hurt, pain, and strife. 
Pushed out and all around, 
so many in the lost and found. 
Deep in a hole, feelings so cold. 
Life on the streets taking its toll. 
There is this hurt like a page torn from a book. 
Feelings taken and mistook. 
Life on the streets is hard to handle. 
No home. Just have to pan-dle. 
Tears fall with fears hitting hard into the ground. 
Lost alone in a silent sound.
