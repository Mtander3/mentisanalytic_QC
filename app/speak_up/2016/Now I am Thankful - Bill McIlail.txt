Now I am Thankful
Bill McIlmail 

When I was living the American Dream, I lost sight of the things I should have been thankful for. I neglected to show and voice that gratitude. I had so much to be thankful for that it embarrasses me to think of how ungrateful I was. I not only didn't say thank you, I didnâ€™t feel thank you. 

I lost most of what was good in my life through prodigal living and finally divorce. I know what I have missed, I know what I should have done differently.

I am thankful first to God for bringing me back from the edge of nothing. Not only has he rescued me, he has accepted me. In response to this, I have learned to be thankful for the smaller blessings as well as the larger blessings. 

When you have less than nothing, you can develop an "attitude of gratitude" for everything you receive. I was on the edge of homelessness after my divorce and during my transition. 

Though I was under a roof, I was without a home. So when a friend offered use of laundry facilities, that touched me to be grateful. This is opposed to my previous attitude of complaining if my clothes weren't folded correctly or some such nonsense.

When I was invited to spend a night in a friend's spare room, I was thankful--especially when I got to take a shower without the schizophrenic motel shower issues. That shower was like a taste of Heaven. Previously, I would complain if I didn't have the right soap. 

When you start selling your possessions to pay for board and your next meal, you tend to become very grateful for someone who will pay pennies for something you treasured as worth so much more. 

When you rest your head not knowing when you might eat again, that sausage biscuit from 7-Eleven tastes like filet mignon. Add an egg and a cup of coffee, and you are grateful for the "gourmet" meal. 

Keeping this attitude of gratitude then becomes a necessary way of life even when God and others start bringing you back into abundance.
