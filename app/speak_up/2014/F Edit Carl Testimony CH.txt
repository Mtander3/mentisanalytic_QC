Jubilee House

I'm soon to be 63 years old. When I was 15, I ran away from home and joined the carnival. That lasted just a few months, but it led to living the next 20 years on the streets. I slept in fields, ditches, under over passes, in abandoned houses, wherever I could be out of the weather and feel safe. I don't know that you ever totally heal from all the rejection and condemnation that comes from living a life like that, and the shame you feel in those rare moments that you allow yourself to feel, goes very deep.

It's been almost 30 years now since I cleaned up and got off the streets. I'd worked with the homeless before, but when I volunteered to work at the Jubilee house I found something I didn't expect. I found people who loved what they were doing. I found a group of people who didn't judge me. They have rules that everybody must abide by, but even when they must enforce the rules, they do it in love, not judgment. I went there hoping I could make a difference in someone's life, and I hope I have. What I didn't realize was how much healing was there for me. The unconditional love I have experienced since I've been a part of this place has touched my heart and brought healing to my soul. Thank you Jubilee house volunteers, and thank you to everybody who hangs out there. You've all made a positive difference in my life.
