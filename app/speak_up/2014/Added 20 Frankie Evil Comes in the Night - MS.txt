QUIET STRENGTH! 
 	Evil comes in the night. She is a beautiful young woman, stunning actually, yet she is homeless and very vulnerable to the wickedness that is on the streets. Last summer, this evil almost cost her her life. A predator, who now is in jail and should remain there,  tried to rape and beat her, perhaps to death, with a brick! I had met this young lady just a few weeks ago, and she appeared to me as one of my daughters or granddaughters. 
 	I immediately liked her. She approached me about my former addiction to pain pills. She told me that she was on a massive amount of morphine for a spinal disease. She wanted to know how I got off the pills. We talked, and then I did not seen her for some days. I had a foreboding in my spirit! It seems the Lord has given me a sense about these things. I thought she was in danger, so I began to really pray for her. Then four days later, she began to tell me this horror story about her being attacked by this man with a brick.
  	She was convinced he meant to have his way with her, and then perhaps, kill her. She said that as he was hitting her on the back of the head, a calm came over her, and she was bold. She said to this evil man. "Hey, I will not scream. Let’s smoke a cigarette!"
 	And then they did, and he suddenly had a change of plans. He was not so willing to continue. He talked for over an hour, and told his life story. She said, "I have to go to the bathroom." He did not want to let her go, but he needed to get high. So he told her, "I will go buy some dope. I will return and we can get high." She pretended to agree; and when he left, she called the police. They found him asleep in her friend’s tent.
 	Ladies, this woman will tell you this, BE AWARE! BE AWAKE! AND ALWAYS BE PREPARED! THESE CAN BE VERY MEAN STREETS, LADIES! YEP!   Frankie
