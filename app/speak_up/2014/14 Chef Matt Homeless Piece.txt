If you have never been homeless you will never know the answer to the question, "how does a person became homeless?"  You have heard the stereotypical answers, I'm sure, but there is more.  People become homeless for many reasons: 
    They could've had a bad home life.
    They could've lived with addicts and felt second to the addiction.   
    They could've got tired of living in poverty and filth.
    Drug and alcohol becomes a form of medication for them to block out the pain and hurt.
    Maybe they never heard the words, "I love you!"
    Maybe they were never hugged as a child.
    Maybe they were abused and told they were worthless.
    There are a lot of reasons one becomes homeless.
    Maybe they were victims of divorce or served in the military and things went south after they finished their tour of duty.
    I was homeless because I choose to live anywhere else but home. I used substances to suppress my pain. Like many, the streets didn't look so bad compared to the present situation.
    Some make it off the streets and some develop the skills needed to live homeless.
    I was a manipulator and con man for years.
    Once after walking around all night I went to a fire station, checked the doors and found one open and went in and slept on the couch.  The police awakened me.
    I told them I thought it was a safe place and that I would be welcomed to stay. They let me go.
    My family abandoned me. I had no real friends. I did what I had to make it.
    In the end, people hold signs to survive and beg for money. Before you judge a man, why don't you ask to hear his story.
