The Life I Want for my Baby
by Whitney

I want my baby to be smart and well loved. I want my baby to know right from wrong. I also pray my baby will be real healthy and in good shape. I wish to teach my kids how to live in God’s ways and to honor our God. I am going to look into my sweet baby’s eyes, and I know the first time our eyes meet, one of us is going to be crying for joy and for the life that we will have. It is the beginning of a friendship, a family, and a new lifestyle. I hope to learn many things while becoming a mom. I look into the mirror now and say, “What will I do?” I’m a little scared, and I don’t want to be a bad mom, but I do hope to learn what to do. It’s going to be hard and a hassle, but many moms overcome it. I hope to be a good influence for my baby and to learn the right things to do so I can teach my baby.

I believe my baby will be strong minded, a fast learner, and a brave individual. I have faith the baby will be smarter than his/her dad, Charles Blackwell, and also that he/she will be the smartest kid in class because I’m going to try to teach the baby all I know and more. 

I’m going to be a good mother to my baby. Also, Charles is going to be the best dad. I know that as a team, we can teach our baby to overcome many things about everyday life.
