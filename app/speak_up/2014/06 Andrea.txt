I have dragonflies in my garden with my pretty rose my life is fill with dream and of another day that beginning I change into a lovely rose for the world to see my life to change the world hunger so I said there no reason to cry I have hope for the future for the world to change and live in peace and harmony.  Because I have hope for the future.

THE HOUSE


Where can you turn when you are homeless.  The only one I can to was God, he help me through this situation it was God.  He never left me when I was homeless.  I got stronger because he didnâ€™t leave me.  I know he was with me.  So being my love for him every day.  At night when I was going to that empty house I pray when I was sleep there every night I use to think that this was my house I said what a beautiful house God has give me whatever I thought of God gave it to me.  He had made me wonderful art, a beautiful voice everything.  He gave me life to stand of a be a wonderful artist.  It so good living for God.  But just like that song said I am shining bright like a diamond.  So just remember think God for you life everyday, and cherish it but we are who God make us and at last we are in his heart forever.
