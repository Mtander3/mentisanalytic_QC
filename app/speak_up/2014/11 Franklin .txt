11 Franklin

And this is my story!  When I was young growing up in Brooklyn, New York, I was about 13 years old and I was coming home from school and a guy asked me if I needed a ride home. I told him, “No, I don’t know you.”  But I got in the car anyway and he raped me and then took me home and gave me a $100 bill.  When I got home I told my mother and then my father came home and he beat me and we got into a fight and my mother told him I was raped and then we went to the hospital.  Then three months later, we moved down to North Carolina and I did not like it down here at first so I ran away from home at 16 years old and went back home to Brooklyn, New York. 

And that’s when I started being homeless off and on.  For the last of the 22nd year of my life, I was in and out of the mental hospital and in and out of jail and prison because I did not have a place to stay so I’d do something to go to jail or prison so I have a place to stay and this is the truth.  I was a fool for the devil and I did not know better at the time.  But when I gave my life to God the Father and his Son, Jesus, my life got better and I left the worst behind me.  I’m still homeless, but I’m living a good life now, and I thank “God” Jehovah for my new life in his son “Jesus” Christ!  My whole life has changed.  I thank God for the room I have now.  To him be the Glory, and I know one day I will have my own house or apartment soon.

This is Franklin Shields and this is a true story of my life.  I do my best to take care of my daughter Christina.  That’s all I want to do is to take care of my little lady.  God gave her to me, and it’s my job to take care of her.

God bless all of you at Speak Up Magazine,

Love Always,
