My Coat
by Lynn Mendes
	While homeless, the one thing I relied on the most was my coat. It wasn’t just any coat. While probably not too expensive, it didn’t belong on the street. It was black, mid-length and fur lined. It kept me warm on the nights I had to spend outdoors and served as a cover for my time at the Travelers Aid. On one particular night I travelled to the Rhode Island area. I stopped in Connecticut and managed to pay for a week’s shelter at the International Hotel. But knowing full well my destination was Rhode Island, where I was from, I decided to leave my paid-for shelter and continue my journey. I was going home. That’s where my family was. 
One night I went to the Warwick Mall in Rhode Island and, having become upset, was told by local police I could “stay outside.” I crossed the street and decided to bed down at the abandoned greenhouse on campus. Needless to say, my black coat with its padded materials, and the music I wrote, served to keep me warm. A hotel bathroom and the basement at my daughter’s apartment were other sources of shelter there, despite an entire week having been paid for in Connecticut. 
As a postscript, on the night I stayed at the greenhouse, I needed to use the bathroom. I leaned back, and much to my surprise, the door to the building opened. I went in, used the bathroom, and left my tennis shoes behind.
