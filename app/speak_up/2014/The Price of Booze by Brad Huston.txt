The Price of Booze by Brad Huston

Six dollars and fifty cents. That’s the going price for a fifth of cheap vodka. Any self-respecting abuser of “spud juice” makes sure there is a steady supply, but when supply is difficult, due to lack of funds, one turns to other ways of obtaining his “medicine”. In an alcoholic induced panic, morals go out the window. All thoughts of right and wrong do onto others or turn the other cheek, cease to exist.

This is a story that left two men dead and another headed to prison for up to twenty years. Try to find some good out of this and please let me know what that might be.

A man was witnessed stealing a bottle of vodka from another man, who was passed out. The thief died shortly thereafter as a result of a severe beating. The beating was administered by a man hired by the passed-out man. It was a beating of retribution. The hired man got carried away.

It wasn’t long before police questioning led them to the hired man, who was arrested, and at the time of this writing is in jail on murder charges and a million dollar bail.

The passed-out man, knew it was only a matter of time before Johnny-Law came calling again.
He was a chronic alcoholic, but his death the next week was drug-induced, not his drug of choice. On the morning of the thief’s memorial we learned the passed-out man had died too.

The code on the streets, which is a strict code, was broken. Thou shall not steal! It is a situation of great sorrow, and yes anger, grief and questions. Numerous people’s lives have been affected. Our street society is on display to all, once again. This is our cost of booze.
