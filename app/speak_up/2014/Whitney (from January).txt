Being homeless is a crazy experience... 
I started off alone on the cold streets struggling to find love. Many people took advantage of me—took my kindness for weakness. I got used and abused, mentally and emotionally, many times; I was so hungry at times, and all I had was water to drink from restaurant restrooms. I had to steal food any chance I got. I lost a lot of weight, and my family turned on me and would not help me out. I felt that I was totally lost and alone. The only person I had in my life was my grandmother, who unfortunately passed away on August 20, 2012.
I slept under bridges, and in abandoned houses and trailers. I was very lucky to be warm most nights, especially when it rained. Those were the worst times.
My life felt as if it was not important, and I was all alone…
I cried many nights, but I soon met my significant other. His name is Charlie. He took away most of my worries, and he makes sure I am always safe and warm and never hungry. For once in my life, I feel completely safe and loved even though I am still homeless and going through the struggles of everyday life. My heart is happy, anyone can touch a heart. One word can change a person’s day. I learned that through my life.
