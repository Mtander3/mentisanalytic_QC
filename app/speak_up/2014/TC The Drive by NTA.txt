The Drive by N.T.A.  

We are all the same in that we are all different.
I was going to a show one day with a friend, Jim. Jim said that Bill was interested in going as well. The more the merrier, right?  I asked Jim what Bill knew about me. "Not much," he said. Not that I had once been homeless. 
The day came for our outing. Jim and I had some coffee and made small talk waiting for Bill. He showed up, and we were introduced. He seemed like a nice enough guy. The three of us headed out and Bill offered to drive. I sat in the front seat. Not long into our expedition, the subject drifted towards the "Street People.” Now Jim knew I had been homeless, living in my car tagged the "Hotel Taurus,” but poor Bill knew nothing about the can of worms he had just opened. 
Bill said how everywhere you look you saw them—always dirty, needing a bath, usually drunk, never working. “Yeah,” I agreed, “often they don't look like someone you want to take home.” I felt like I was throwing myself under the bus. “But ya know,” I said, “I've seen some that are clean, smart, educated, even Christians. Mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, employed, as well as unemployed. Shoot, you never know when you might find yourself sitting right next to one.”
He looked over at me and changed the subject. 
We are all the same in that we are all different.
