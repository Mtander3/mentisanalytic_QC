    Coty’s Story:I can sum up how I came into the homeless lifestyle in one word:  “denial.”  I wasn’t homeless.  I was in between jobs and down on my luck.  I have hit bumps in my life’s road before.  The only difference was I always had a roof over my head.  What I last found out was that there was a rock bottom, and I had hit it.  That put me in such a state of depression that I had lost all the self-respect I had left.  Right when I convinced myself that God had left me, He sent me my new brother: Brian.  From the moment we laid eyes on each other, it was brotherly love.   We both felt it.  We filled the void we had in our hearts.  God had replaced the family I lost when I was 13 years old.  Brian and I never left each other’s side and always had each other’s backs.  We were no longer homeless because we had each other.   We were just houseless.  After a few months, Brian met the love of his life: Holly.  I now had a sister added to my family.  I grew to love her as well.  They were to be married on my birthday:  April 12, 2014.  Now, the three of us were inseparable.  But, the Lord had a different plan and took Brian home to be with him on December 12, 2013.  It was and will be the saddest day of my life.  With the help of God and my friends, I came out of my valley of sorrow, and I claimed strength I never knew I had.  With that strength, I have pulled through some hard times, so that I could enjoy the good times and friends He has put on my paths.  With His help and Brian’s, I am looking forward to seeing how this journey ends.  I decided to share my story so people will know that just because people are homeless, it doesn’t mean that we don’t feel pain due to the loss of a family member or loved one.We receive joy from the blessings God gives us.
