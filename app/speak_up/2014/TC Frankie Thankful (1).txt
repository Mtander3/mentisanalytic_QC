TC Frankie Thankful

My name is Frankie. You have to know that for those who find themselves living on the street, it is so, so difficult just to eat and stay dry and warm. This can be a daily hardship. I have traveled from Michigan to Florida, been in homeless camps from Stewart to Key West, and I will tell you this: Traverse City, you have a huge heart for all the street people! This is rare, for in many places I have been, the homeless are invisible to most people. Not here in T. C. Nope. Much love is given through all the churches who feed, house, and just minister God’s love. We out here say, “Thank you, Traverse City.” Every man deserves dignity, and this paper will give some who are willing to put in the time some of their dignity back! The homeless are not invisible. I am a former 33-year morphine addict, from three back surgeries and over 30 hospitalizations. Before I was 30, I was an addict. I am 61 today, and I am out of that morphine fog! Yep, I am alive. 

I do so love my life now, but my 30 plus years of addiction have caused much pain to my children. I lost my high school sweetheart after 33 years of marriage. She just had enough. There is much I must work through in my family. I have three beautiful daughters and three great sons, 12 natural grandchildren and three step-grandsons! All but one daughter will have nothing to do with me, and this is pain way deeper than the physical pain. Yet, I know that in my recovery, I must trust in the Lord to heal where only He can, so I am plugged into life and each new day I desire the very marrow of that day. Yep, to live it fully no matter my situation, for I am learning to live one day at a time. My life some day will show my children I am a free man, no more bound by anything but God’s love for me.
