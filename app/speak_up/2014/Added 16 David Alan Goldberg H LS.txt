DIRT
Dirt, being dirty is a wide and varied substance. It could be the dirtiest of all dirt, or not so much. What are we talking about in relation to dirt, really? Dust bunnies under the couch or Miley Cyrus?

HUMAN RACE 100K
I ran. I ran so far away. When I was on the streets, it was all this human could do to maintain any reasonable amount of sanity. San Francisco, Portland, across town, down the block. Away. Anywhere but here.

COFFEE
In my youth and for many years, I would drink at least six cups of coffee daily, the strength of motor oil used in NASCAR. Pardon the pun, but it fueled my creativity in ways better than anything else. I am still running off the fumes.

ETHICS
Tactfulness, propriety, punctuality, fairness, humility. A little bit of each, practiced sincerely and consistently goes a long way. However, at the end of the day, and after several cappuccinos, we all poop.
SHOP
Blume Junior High School, Wapakoneta, Ohio. I attended seventh and eighth grade there in the late 1970s. Its claim to fame is that the first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, attended Blume when he was a kid. In eighth grade, I took wood and metal shop in one of the same classrooms where Armstrong was taught. After the ‘78-’79 school year, there was a parade honoring the ten-year-anniversary of the moon landing. I got to shake his hand.
