Surviving  the night! When the temp hits below zero, you must GET INSIDE, OR YOU MAY DIE!, THAT IS THE COLD HARD FACT OF LIVING ON THE STREET IN NORTHERN MICHIGAN.  Forty degrees and lower - this cold KILLS! Period. 
Sometimes in the winter you do not have a roof over your head.  For whatever reason you missed the church bus that was to take you to the church for the night, or you drank too much and are barred from the churches.  What do you do?? Well, praise God, for the Banks’ ATM LOBBIES! Yep, they are heated and an ATM provides a shelter from the bitter cold.  These are a life saver. Another place is the Post Office lobby! Yep, both are always open and HEATED HA! If not for these two places, other than Walmart, or Meijers, and you cannot sleep in these stores, you have to be constantly moving. In these two stores, you are watched if you be in there too long without buying anything. So stay away from these, unless you are stuck there as in a blizzard or something; then you will not be alone. There will be others.
But besides these, there is no place to go to get out of the cold, unless, as I said, you get to the bank or Post Office lobby.  You must sleep, so you’ve got to find a warm dry place inside, where you can get sleep. These two lobbies provide this shelter.  Thank you bank lobbies, thank you Post Office. I do not know what I would do without you two WHEN  CAUGHT OUTSIDE in the bitter, long Northern Michigan Winters!
