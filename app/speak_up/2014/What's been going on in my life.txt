What’s Been Going on in My Life?
by Tawanna

Well, as of lately, my life has been just that...my life. There seems to be something trying to steal my joy. Things go smoothly for a while, all blue skies and sunny days, and then things just start going south. I find out that the rent that my boyfriend and I are paying is not going to the homeowner but to a shady middleman, so he plans evict us. My boyfriend lost his job, so we don’t have money to move. I got a check in the mail that could help, but I can’t cash it. This check came from losing everything I had in storage. 

I know life can’t be all blue skies and sunshine but sometimes something’s got to give. My boyfriend and I don’t have any idea what we’re going to do. I feel like I’m back at square one. Pray for me.
