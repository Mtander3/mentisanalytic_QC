Did you ever think when you were young, living in that nice warm house with your family—watching television every night, playing your games, talking on the phone, eating and drinking and sleeping in that warm cozy bed at night—that a day would come when you didn’t have all of those comforts of life? Was that ever a thought in your mind? Was it ever a conceivable idea to you? It certainly wasn’t one of my thoughts.

I have been experiencing all of the things I never imagined I would ever experience. I am homeless. Up until three years ago, I never thought I would be. 

Sometimes the worst part of being homeless is waking up each morning knowing that it’s another day of homelessness. I used to stay at a shelter. I’ve done the abandoned house thing, the under-a-bridge thing, and even the in-a-doorway thing sometimes. But now I sleep in a tent, which isn’t too bad because I have my companion and best friend with me each and every day. She keeps me in a sane state of mind most of the times. We’re surviving each day with God’s protection, even though sometimes things seem almost unmanageable.

It’s definitely a daily struggle having to maintain every day, but fortunately we have each other and we have faith that things will get better in time. We have also met a few encouraging people along our journey who have been a big help to us. Nothing is promised us every day… That’s a lesson in life that we all must learn… HOMELESSNESS can happen to anyone, anywhere, and at any time, but as long as we have our faith, NOTHING is impossible to overcome. Whether you’re under a bridge, in a cardboard box, in an abandoned house, or even in a tent, your faith and the positive people you keep in your life will carry you through!
