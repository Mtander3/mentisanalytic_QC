I know what it's like to be so hungry it hurts. I spent a lot of years living on the streets. In the end I was crippled by my drinking and drug use. I checked into the shelter in Ann Arbor, again. The only reason they let me in was because I couldn't walk, but they were tired of watching me come and go. Nobody was willing to waste their time helping me, so I finally started helping myself.  I pushed myself as hard as I could trying to walk. After a few months I could get around again.

I started drinking, then my wife died of an overdose. That lit a fire under me. A friend of mine said I could stay with him for a month but I couldn't drink and had to go to A.A.  Before I knew it, I had been there a year, hadn't drunk, was getting my driver's license back after seventeen years without it. Now, in spite of being a felon several times over, I am gainfully employed, I own my own house, I am getting custody of my youngest son. To most people I look “normal,” even though most of my life I was a dirty junkie that they would cross the street to avoid.

I've been sober four years now and can only guess how much better it will get.
