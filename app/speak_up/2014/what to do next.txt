I was asked this question at my writing class, and here is my answer. Well that is a direct question, so I will give a direct answer: the very same thing I am doing right now. I am being obedient to my Lord, first and foremost. !  

Right now, my life could not be much fuller. The joy I have is truly unspeakable and full of the Lord’s glory.  I daily have the privilege of living among the very best of people, my homeless family.  Right now, I am  so much closer to many out here, yes, closer  than to my own family! Last year at this time, I was so, so alone, even though I was surrounded by my OWN. Many of my family were only one mile away, yet, I never saw them.  So, now I see the people I have come to love daily.  I get to speak openly to them; no judgment, no egos out here, just real Americans  who have been ripped off by society, especially my Warrior Brothers and Sisters, the veterans! hey are surely America’s BEST! They deserve better than this[homelessness].  

So I plan to do as I do now. In my future, I hope to bring national awareness of the CRISIS IN AMERICA--THE HOMELESS VETERAN! This SHOULD NEVER, EVER BE IN MY AMERICA! SO I WILL USE THE POWER  OF THE PEN TO BRING THIS AWARENESS TO ALL AMERICANS!
