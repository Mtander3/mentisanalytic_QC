The Cold Blue Streets

by Sheila

It’s another homeless story of hurt and despair. 
Lost, alone and no one that cares. 
Rain, pain and the concrete walls come crashing in. 
Sometimes it seems that you have reached your end. 
A summer breeze rustling through the trees whispers to you that you are free. 
Free from hurt and despair, free from all who don’t care. 
God hears and knows and cares. 
He never goes. 
He is always there. 
A star seems to be so far but you keep on keeping on 
Till one day you will go home.
