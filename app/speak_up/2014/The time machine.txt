The Time Machine

When I was a child, things were different. We had a crank telephone and a black and white television with only two channels. In kindergarten, I walked two miles to school to one of the last two-room school houses in Michigan where they taught K-eighth grades. We used a ringer washer and a line outside to dry the clothes. My mom would spend the fall canning fruits and vegetables for the winter. What a change it means to be canning now.

I’ve seen many changes too: the world, the sexual revolution, flower children, wars, and the death of a president whose son gave a final salute--a gesture that touched the whole world. On television, I heard a man talk of the equality of man; later he was silenced, yet his dream lives on.  History has moved on, and I lived during the times of the stories I relate.  These stories are windows into the past just as the stories that you relate will be.

When I was a child, the stories from the last generation before my youth were different than mine. Stories of the Great Depression and the changing of the meaning of house power, how machinery changed their world and them. Stories of hope, love and courage in hard times, stories of great men who spoke out without fear for what was right and the right thing to do. Stories of a world at war against a man who thought that others who were not like him were not human and should be done away with. 

Who will write the next great American chapter? Who will tell our stories if no one will speak up? Who, if not you and me? Maybe then  someone won’t see the worth of you and me.
