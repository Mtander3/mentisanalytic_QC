If I could go back to 18 what would I change?

	If I could go back to 18, some things would be different. I would not use marijuana. I would appreciate the chance to receive a decent education. And I wouldn’t try so hard to impress my peers. All of these issues are the reasons why my life is so unmanageable. If I could go back, I would have done everything differently. 
	If I could go back to 18, I would have never smoked marijuana. The drug has caused me to lose opportunities like being in the military, keeping a jobs, etc. Also, it has caused me to become very complacent, lazy, and forgetful. Because of it I’ve had extreme mood swings. My drug use cost thousands of dollars. From 18th to my age now (29) I have spent at least $30,000 that is money I could have used on more important things, like my daughter, an apartment, clothes, etc.
	When I was 18 I didn’t respect or appreciate the opportunity to be blessed with a chance to receive a quality education. I didn’t realize that citizens are paying for me to go to school; I thought it was something that was free, something that the government had to do. I didn’t pay attention to all of the other students who did appreciate it, doing their work, going to class, following the rules, graduating in college with successful careers and families. For those of us who didn’t; we landed in jail or got hurt or died.
When I was 18, I tried so hard to fit in and impress the other students. This caused me to do things that I shouldn’t have done, like drugs, defy authority and make poor choices and decisions. Trying to be accepted caused me to get into a lot of trouble, which increased suspension, expulsion, etc.
	If I could do it all over again, I’d keep my eyes on the future. I would surround myself with good people. I’d learn how to use my money wisely.
That is what I’m doing now. I’m 29 years old and trying to turn my life around. It’s getting better.
