True Believer
by Douglas E. Lawing


I’m a true believer

In the story of Christ.

How he walked without sin

Then he paid the price.

He was bold as a lion

And meek as a sheep.

When they slapped him on the face

He turned the other cheek.

He took a couple of fish

And a basket of bread

And fed 5,000

With plenty food left.

He came down from the mountain

Turned the water to wine

Healed the wounds of the lamb

And gave sight to the blind.

He was the greatest man

That will ever be

And he gave it all away

For you and me.

I used to walk in the dark

Alone out in the streets

With chains on my heart.

I had to rob just to eat.

Scammin’ every morning

To get my fix.

When the going got ruff

I had to learn new trix.

Then I’d keep’a rollin’

Not a care in my head.

The way things were goin’

I should surely be dead.

But I now walk with Jesus

I’ve been burnt by his fire.

And there ain’t no dope

That can get me higher.

The fire burns in my heart.

Ya see, it lights up my eyes

And the flama’ keep’a burnin’

Till the day I die.

Now listen everybody

What I’ve got to say.

If you wanna get to Heaven

He’s the only way.

You gotta lay down your life

And die to your sin.

Open up your heart

He’ll come on in.

He’ll clean up your mess

With his blood and water.

Be your best friend

Your brother and Father.

When you call his name

He’s always around.

You know He’s got your back

Won’t ever let you down.

And if you slip in the mud 

When you’re lost in the dark

He’ll clean up the mess

And give you a new start.
