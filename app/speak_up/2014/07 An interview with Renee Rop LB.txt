An interview with Renee Rop  
Renee, did you grow up in Traverse City?
No, I grew up in Richland, Michigan, near Kalamazoo. I came to Traverse City in 2005 for treatment at the Dakoske Rehab Center. Afterwards, I got a job at a transition house and liked the area, so I stayed.  
Tell me about someone who was an inspiration to you growing up?
My grandmother, Rop, was a really loving and unconditional woman. We used to paint ceramic angels and animals together. She’d give them to me to take home. I’d spend weekends with her and my grandfather. She worked for a paper company, and he drove semis. I lost the figurines though, when I became homeless in 2007.
How are your magazine sales going?
  Good. I sold my first one out on the sidewalk in front of Brilliant Books back in September or October.  I sell them mostly to friends, but I’m thinking of selling at the State Theatre or at some of the local churches. 
Where are your favorite places to eat and hang out in TC?
  I like to hang out at Horizon Books. They have good coffee, and I like to sit by the front window and watch what’s going on out on the street. I like to eat at North Peak when I have the money. I love their Portabella Steak Salad.
What’s the hardest part of your life right now?
Staying sober and recovery. I’ve been sober four and a half months.
And where will you sleep tonight?
At the Women’s Resource Center. I’ve been there about a month. They’ve helped me out of an abusive situation.
Where do you see yourself in five years?
Doing substance abuse counseling and care management. I have a Master’s Degree in Counseling, and now that I have personal experience being on the street and in recovery, I would like to parlay this into helping others. 
How has the recent wintry weather affected you?
Oh, it’s aggravating my arthritis, affecting my mood, and making me tired. Sometimes it’s a struggle to stay warm and dry.
