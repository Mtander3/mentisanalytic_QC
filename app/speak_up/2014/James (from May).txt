CONCRETE DREAMS
I’m transitioning from house to hobo. 
I’ve already signed my lease. 

I will be sleeping in that bush next to your car, 
and your car starting will be my alarm clock. 

I will be invisible but stand out. 

I will live a lavish lifestyle, 
created and renewed every day.

I will be the stranger you want to forget. 

I will be the landmark for adventure. 

I’m in the midst of all that is to come, 
waiting to transition and transcend onto the next phase, 
cautious of every step I take. 

If I could only focus for this very second. 
I’d know we’re all in the midst of dreaming and creating 
our own very existence into reality.
