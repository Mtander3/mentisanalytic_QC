I saw this crazy girl around the “trap” spot with her cut up shirt and big 'ol backpacks, and I didn't know what to think. Then all of the sudden, and I do mean all of the sudden, God told me to marry this chick and I best not leave her. So, ok thanks God! I started to see that she loved cutting her shirts. I didn't understand what the big deal was. It was weird to me at first, but I began to realize women actually like that kind of stuff! It changed over the years from, "Hey I like your shirt," to "Can you make me one?" People love the fact that she does it herself. She has always had the idea for a business, but now she wanted me involved. I was like, ok whatever, I'll ride. We didn't even start selling shirts until the time came in our lives when we would use them to survive. We learned a lot about how people valued those shirts and her talent. I mean she would say "Pick your price" and they would give her $20 or more for one shirt! That was cool, but to this day I still think it's weird! God Is good though. 

She would pray for a store and we would go store shopping. There was a lot of no's. I felt bad for her, and despite my own thoughts on the whole thing, I remained positive with her. I kept focused on calling what was not as though it is. Hey, I hated for her to ask all these people to let her put some shirts in their store because they just say no anyway. But a closed mouth don't get fed. She believed God gave her this talent for a reason, and he's going to give her a store. I mean, she used the shirt cutting as a witnessing tool. Her bait for fishing men for Christ. I held on to her faith in the shirts, and time after time I was amazed at how well they did. Low and behold, one day someone said, "Yes!" That night was loud with our excitement.
