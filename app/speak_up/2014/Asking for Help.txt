                Asking for Help     

In the Summer of 2011, I was attacked and beaten with clubs on my ten acres. I was threatened with a gun and beaten some more. When the beatings were over, they held a gun on me and told me that I best keep quiet or they will come back and finish the job.

In October 2012, my dog and best friend, Freedom, was poisoned. He died in my arms. I was devastated.  After more acts of violence against me, I left the area. I had never heard of Safe Harbor or The Jubilee House in Traverse City until I sought help. I do not seek help easily, but I knew I seriously needed it.

Goodwill Outreach coordinator, Ryan Hannon, gave me the opportunity to help clean up areas where homeless people had abandoned their camps. I also picked up cigarette butts and trash all over Traverse City area.

 	I always volunteer to help with projects at the churches that allowed Safe Harbor people to eat and sleep there. I do things like rake leaves, shovel snow or clean tables. My favorite church is the Central United Methodist Church. They have breakfast and showers five days a week. I used to try to be the first in line for the showers. They also have their own Outreach workers who are fantastic. Donna Weitz, the outreach worker and fabulous humanitarian, helped me by continuing to push me toward other agencies that eventually helped me to get my own apartment.

Because of my injuries from the beatings, I was unable to work and lost my property. Today, because I kept putting my best foot forward as best that I could, I see my own home in one year.   

Always because of asking for help...
