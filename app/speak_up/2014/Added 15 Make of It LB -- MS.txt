Make of It What You Will

I am a teenager in society, a daughter to parents and a sister to four siblings, a girlfriend to someone who saved me. Whoever knew life could be so lonely? 
In this world we talk of compassion, peace and love but receive and see so very little of it. Home is where it all begins, isn’t it? The same home that pushed me out, the same home that crumbled my insides, and the same home where I screamed, pleaded and cried. Now, standing between everything I have ever known and life on my own, I walk. I walk away from all the disappointments, all the misunderstandings and all the misjudgments to prove my dedication and what I believe to be right. 
Now, the bitter cold enters my bones, December 26th never felt so lonely. On the park bench I’ve walked by thousands of times taking for granted its valuable resources. My hands are buried. I long for the warmth of a home, the warmth of love, yet the winter keeps me numb, keeps me cold. Why not freeze these racing thoughts lost in the mind maze of foolishness? I think so hard, so much until pitch black falls from the sky into my mind. 
My blurred conscience is awakened by distant conservations, the screeching of the playground apparatus and the laughter of kids. My legs begin walking before my mind is fully aware of the condition that I am in. Parents cover the eyes of their kids as I begin to wonder what to do next. Days and weeks go by and I wonder, would anybody care? Just another teenage drama.
