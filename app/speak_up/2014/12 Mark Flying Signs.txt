12 Flying Signs -- Mark

Flying the cardboard as it's known is a fine and time honored form of homeless survival.  It's panhandling, that's true, however it isn't forcing yourself upon someone.  The truly savvy do it from Interstate off-ramps.  It just makes sense; a vehicle choke point where the drivers have to look at your pitiful self.  The real art to flying the cardboard lies in the sign itself.  Humor and honesty are surefire messages that get people digging in their ashtrays for change.  Some of my personal favorites include:

I'm way too sexy to be homeless need $ for plastic surgery to be ugly.

Adopt a homeless motherfucker.

My panhandling addiction is out of control.

Entirely dysfunctional and completely honest.

My Sharpie marker and cardboard habit is getting expensive.

(Yes, I've used all of these)
