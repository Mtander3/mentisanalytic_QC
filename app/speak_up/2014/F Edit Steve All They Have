All They HaveThough not old in appearance,this woman across the room from me has to use a cane.Or so she just  thinks, maybe.The cane is not old or wooden, either.It is decorated with loud purple and verdant green paisley leaves--with silver shining through in between.She uses it, in-sync with her steps,to make her way to the toaster, then to a table with the toast in her other hand.She then gets two cups of  coffee,  one at a time,  just the same.When her husband enters, all is in place.But he is tilted in frame by some back injury it would appear. Still, the symmetry.For when they are seated, they look through the newspaper's section called Body and Soul First, they find the classifieds,apparently looking  for a place to live.They talk in confidential whispers as if not wanting anyone else to see where they might go.Soon they are looking at their horoscopes: her, hunched over, squinting,following the printed lines with her forefingeras if it is a solid and tried map. He, perhaps just knowing she believes in them, at least somewhat. And that is okay. I surmise: They are all they have.And I surmise that if they were to read my horoscopeit would say:Today you will grow jowls, become rumpled in the morning, have more gray hair, and have achey joints. Look in the Mirror.Don't look in the mirror.Get a cane.No--Get a wife.But by all means don't.For you are all you have. Quit surmising others.
