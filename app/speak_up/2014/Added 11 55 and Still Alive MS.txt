55 and Still Alive

As I remember almost losing my life this summer 
I can tell you for certain, it was definitely a bummer
Freedom & I are now living in my RV with very little heat
I vow to the Greater Whole that I will never again be beat

With no money to buy my grandchildren anything new for them
Having them in my life, they are my favorite gem
If I could sell all that I have and save my land, it would be told
My grandchildren can certainly have it, if I may be so bold

In all my pains I realize that I am no longer Super Hippie
As I now walk through this life, I may seem a little gimpy
When I was younger, I could climb many size trees
And back then I seemed to do it with such ease
It was nothing to jump from a roof to the ground
Hitting the ground, tuck & roll, all in a single bound

Beer when it’s near, wine to dine, 
Liquor is quicker; but with booze ya lose
And on the Good Red Road, 
I try not to make booze what I choose

Now when people’s integrity is just faked
All I really want to do is get really baked
Most of my Native Elders have passed onto some place that is not new
I will always treasure the wonderful knowledge they shared of what they knew
With Song Bird as my great Clan
I will certainly figure out a plan

This life of mine sure does go fast
What is done for Christ is all that will last
I am now 55 and still alive
And pray my friendships will last
