The Icy Claws of Winter
     Winter is a season I used to like in my youth.   When I was younger, the cold temperatures never used to bother me. I could stay out most of the day making snow angels, tobogganing , and ice skating on a clear sheet of glass while looking at the bottom to see what I could see.
      Now the white blanket of snow really gets me depressed. When I see the first flakes, I shudder wanting the warmth of the sun and not the dark, short days of winter craving the heat from spring. Waiting in line for five minutes to get into Safe Harbor feels like hours.  Often it is so cold it is hard to sign my name from shivering.
     Winter has become a cold bitter creature with icy claws, and I am always having to watch my step, in fear of falling on the ice. Dressing in layers for warmth that does not come, for once I get cold, I cannot get warm again. The subzero temperatures make me pray that spring is coming around the corner, yet it doesnâ€™t come.  The cold breathe of the monster is still at the door, the beast with icy claws.
