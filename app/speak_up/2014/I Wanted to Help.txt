I Wanted to Help
 by Tawanna Glass

There was something so familiar about you...until the other day when you spoke, and your words weren't those of the happy people. I locked onto your eyes, and immediately my heart began to pound. Tears began to build in my eyes. I had to excuse myself. I didn't want you to know that I could see your pain. When I came back, you were gone. I wanted to ask you if there was anything I could do. I wanted to help you whether it be through prayer, a hug, or an ear.
