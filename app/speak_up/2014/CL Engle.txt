Better Than It Seems
By C.L. Engle

I was at my post selling Speak Up Zine yesterday.  Some strangers walked up and I heard “There's Uncle Chuck!” To my amazement  it was a nephew and a niece, Jason and Hilary. I hadn't seen them in at least eight years. I told them I wouldn't have recognized them—they used to be teenagers.  We hugged and talked—they couldn't believe I was in a homeless shelter.  When they knew me I had a great job, owned my house, had three cars, a riding lawnmower and a bass boat. They gave me a love offering.  I told them it wasn't as bad as they thought.

This magazine is giving me a job and an opportunity to do what I've always desired, to launch a writing career. I'm getting disability after a year out in the woods, and I have a clear shot at getting a place to rent and a laptop. I'm devoted to giving Traverse City all I've got and being a part of Helping Hands.   Traverse City, I love you. Thanks for helping me believe.
