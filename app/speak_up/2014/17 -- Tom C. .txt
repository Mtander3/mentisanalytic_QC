Trading a Broomstick for Sneakers
 by Tom Costantini

I lived in Ohio for awhile working as a temp worker. One day, I found out that there were budget cuts, and I was out of work. After learning this, I went home to get some sleep and planned to find work in the morning. At about one in the morning, an electrical fire started. I saved what I could, but I lost a lot of my possessions. Just as the embers were dying at 3 am, my slumlord showed up and asked everyone for rent. I ignored him, took my two-month’s rent, and traveled for a few weeks. 

On Valentine’s Day, I showed up in Charlotte and started looking for work. There were people who helped me through my travels by giving me food or a bit of cash. When March arrived, I was brought to Speak Up. These people helped me a lot, in a way that taught me a lot. Here, I feel like I belong.
 
When I was in Ohio, I was an outcast, on the outside looking in. You see, I am a witch. Some people think that means I’m evil, but I am misunderstood. 

But people here let me in, and have taken the time to get to know me, even those people whose beliefs are very different than mine. And the Speak Up family does something I respect: shows what it's like to be homeless by sharing our stories with the public.
 
I think that our world is in need of peace. To bring our world together, people need to quit judging others and shutting them out before they know them. Once this happens, we can bring balance to the world and make it better for future generations. That, I think, will be a great gift to give before one passes into the next life. 

This is what I dream about.
