“What does a homeless person look like?” More often than not, we don’t know who is or isn’t. I give everyone the benefit of the doubt upon meeting them, treating them with respect and kindness. It’s up to them in their responses to add to or take away.

I have always been a pretty neat, fairly well-dressed guy, even when I was homeless and hooked on drugs. There were times when I would go to get drugs and the dealers wouldn’t want to sell to me, thinking I was the police. Some people would say that I was just too well clad to be homeless. My response would be: “When I had money, I knew what to do with it.” Another magazine vendor told me I should not wear what I was wearing because I don't look homeless. Again, what does a homeless person look like?
