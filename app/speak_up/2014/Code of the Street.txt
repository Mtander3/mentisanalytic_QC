Code of the Street (sayings and poems by several)
You cannot fake it till you make it on the street. You must be you, else people who live on the street will first distrust, dislike, and just dis you. The street has a code: Be yourself—warts and all, do not try to fit in, do not try to force yourself on others. You have to be open and have to be respectful. 
Do not try to be someone else if you be new to homelessness. Then look for the strong ones. They will be there—those that I call watchmen. They will be gracious and more than willing to help you. But do not put your guard down. Be aware. Be awake.  Be alive. The street can be mean but it can also be very loving. You can meet people who will love you without judgment, without prejudice. On the street, mos. Guard your spirit, and body. This is the code of the street.  Just be who you be, no faking. –Frank



I’m not always delusional. Sometimes I’m just wrong.
Don’t let the things you own own you. –Tyler





Be kind.
Be respectful of everyone you meet.
Try to make someone smile.—Randy Parcher
