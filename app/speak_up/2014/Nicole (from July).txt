Becoming Homeless:

Being tortured,
Institutionalized
Then jailed to all three, at the same time, invisibly;
In what appeared to be fresh air
I was grateful to be,
Waiting on mines,
Spitting out rhymes,
Naturally for me,
Ahead of the times in my mind,
All writing, they called it blind,
Yet it’s how I always appeared to see,
Chose to be a “He”,
All for a protection of thee,
Knowing end body was always “Carina,” the she, me,
As well as “In the beginning,”
Making a partner to be greater
So that I may be free.
