My name is Chuck Allen, and recently I’ve been in the newspaper and on the news for running a marathon. The catch was and still is, I’m homeless. My teammate and I finished the marathon in less than four hours. Then the TV station gave us a follow-up interview. While running this marathon, I came up with the idea that I ought to do some house-sitting.

While I am still looking for regular work, I am also looking for house-sitting jobs. If my marathon training taught me anything, it taught me reliability and responsibility. Jobs like this are new to me, but I’m up for the task. I can do simple tasks like mowing the grass, walking the dog, keeping the house clean, and checking the mail. If you are going to be away for a while and need a house-sitter, then I’m your guy.
