Take time to see!

I wonder what you saw when that man walked by,
did you see any more then a man with a sigh? 
What was your thought when you caught your first view,
did your heart go out to him, or did you see him as taboo?
I wonder if when you saw how he was dressed,
if it made you smile, or feel some distress?
If you had looked twice when you saw him the first time, 
would you have seen his emptiness, or that he needed to dine.
I wonder if you'd paused to really look at him,
if you'd seen his old shoes or his hurting grin.
There's no way to know what one might see,
there's no way to know what might be the key.
The key to what you might now be thinking,
I noticed the man, he looked like he'd been drinking.
Now I'm not joking, I'm telling you straight,
the key to our life is simple but great.
We all need each other in one way or another, 
when we see someone on the street, they're our sister or our brother. 
We all need each other, that right there is the key.
the sooner we get that, the sooner we can be free.
So next time you pass someone on the street,
look a little closer and don't be so discreet.
Just smile and say hi, cuz you never know, 
he might be an Angel without their halo. 
He may need your help or you may need his,
he may be named John, George, Mary, or Liz.
There's one thing for sure if this is the case,
we all need each other, whether in rags or in lace. 

Mark 12:30
Love The Lord your God with all you Heart, Soul, mind and Strength, and love your neighbor as yourself.
