Jerry died recently. He was a homeless person living in the Civic Center. He had no family and his last wish was to have a family, but he did have one in those who knew him. Outgoing, friendly, with a smile for everyone he met. He will be missed.
 
He faced the big question every night: Where will you sleep? Will it be under one of the bridges, on a park bench in the open, or on the couch of a friend?  During the winter there is safe harbor, but in the summer we have to sleep where we can, being on guard at all times. The homeless are a target, thought of as invisible. They are non-persons that no one will care about or miss. They have to not only worry about other homeless, but also teenagers having some fun by destroying everything that a homeless person owns. 

One day we stopped to see how Jerry was doing, only to find that someone had taken everything he had, leaving him with just the clothes on his back. It was the beginning of summer but the nights were still cold. As we had sleeping bags we were not using, we gave them to Jerry. It was no big deal to us, as we had no use for them, but to Jerry it was as if we had given him the keys to the city. We never know how much one act of kindness can mean to someone until we see the look upon their face.
