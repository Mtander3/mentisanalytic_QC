Homelessness is being exhausted all the time.  
Homelessness is waking up refreshed and lucid on one of those rare mornings when you found a place to sleep, undisturbed.  
Homelessness is making valiant, almost magical attempts at blending in with your surroundings, and societyâ€™s ridiculous expectations.  
Homelessness is being too tired to give a flying fart, so your head falls wherever you feel safe. 
Homelessness is doing anything to make an honest buck, even if it means compromising your self-respect.  
Homelessness is the martial art of honing your skills as a hustler so that you may make a decent living (for someone living on the streets) by any means necessary.
