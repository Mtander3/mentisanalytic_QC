‘Interview with Sheila Apperson who sells Speak Up Magazine in Charlotte, NC


What has been your biggest achievement?

Being able to write poetry.

What has been your biggest challenge?

Dealing with life’s changes and trying to make my life better.

What are your hopes for the future?

To have a good job, do well, and move into a nice place--a real home.

What is special about your country?

Donald Trump is the president. He's hilarious. He is making everyone laugh, even if they don't like him. Plus he's a redheaded man. And I love redheaded man.

A lot of things are being addressed now that haven't been addressed in a long time—like national security. Plus freedom. Freedom of speech and freedom to be who you want to be. You can be successful in your own business.

If you were boss of the world for one day, what would you do?

Marry Donald Trump. Just kidding. I read all about him. I was curious and now I know all about him. 

But for real, I would try to negotiate peace in the world.

How has selling Speak Up changed your life?

It’s been a wonderful organization that has given me strength and the ability to write my poems. It’s about doing the Lord’s work. It helps people with their self esteem, livelihood and spirituality.
