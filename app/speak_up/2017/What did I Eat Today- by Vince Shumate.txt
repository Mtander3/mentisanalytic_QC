What did I eat today?

I woke this morning around 5:30 as usual. I was slightly hungry but not so much due to anxiety associated with "sleeping rough." When I get really anxious, I have little or no appetite. I really can't tell you how much I've had to eat in the past week except that it was very little. My food stamp benefits were used up, and my benefits don't get recharged until the 11th. Yesterday, I had several packs of peanut butter crackers, then a can of tuna fish around 9pm. That was it.  

Today, someone offered me some crackers and coffee. I accepted the coffee and passed on the crackers. I went to a resource center today to change into some fresh clothes. They were serving some type of pasta and cheese stuff. I had to pass on that too. Most of the food at soup kitchens has been donated and is way past the "best if used by" date. I was handed a bag of food the other day at one of the soup kitchens. The potato chips were dated 2015 and the Skittles were dated 2014. They were both probably safe to eat, but you can imagine what two-year-old potato chips taste like. I don't have to imagine, they were very stale. 

To tell the truth, if I do get hungry later this evening, I'll take my chances on finding some food recently placed in the sidewalk trash cans in the ritzy area of town. The other day, I found a styro tray of sushi. Later that same day, I found a styro tray with about half a roast duck, not chicken, not turkey--but clearly marked roast duck that was superbly cooked and seasoned.  Just thinking about how good it was is causing me to salivate. 

One thing is for sure. If I get extremely hungry tonight, there will be another residentially-challenged person out on one of the sidewalks willing to share any food they may have.
