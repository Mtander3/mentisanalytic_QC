"Flying the Flag on Freedom Drive"

Why are they out there? What causes someone to wind up homeless? What situations were they in? What bad fortune, bad decisions or bad luck put them there?

Sally had two children, Bridget 12, and Johnny 8, and a great guy for a husband, Gary. Running two family businesses and working. Two cars and a nice house.

One seemingly normal day, Sally and Gary go off to work. The kids to school. All seems right with the world. Unfortunate circumstances and bad fortune had other plans.

Sometime in the afternoon, Gary is working in his shop right next door to a chemical manufacturer. He hears an explosion. Being the good man he is, he rushes to help. While helping to put out the fire, Gary breathes in noxious fumes and is dead by dinner time.

Sally is devastated. She can't function. The house is a mess, the kids are a mess. Sally is a mess. What can she do? How can she cope? Enter a well-intentioned but extremely misguided friend. "Here, let me give you a shot of this. You'll feel better." And she does feel better, but for a brief time. So the next day, the next shot..then it becomes a "fix.” So begins the course of addiction. 

Over a brief period of time, Sally loses her job, her cars, her house. The daughter moves in with friends and loses touch with her mother. The son is taken in by the paternal grandparents.

All Sally has left is her addiction and a piece of cardboard that says, "PLEASE HELP.”
