Homelessness by Sheila Apperson

Homelessness is a huge problem all over the world. People can end up homeless due to so many factors in their lives. People seem to withdraw from other people during homelessness. I think one reason could be that they think they will be judged by people who donâ€™t even know their situation. A homeless person may want to escape from the judgments of some people.
 
I think what the world needs is love and awareness that Jesus is coming back. And one day when He does, all the saved ones will go to a glorious home in Heaven.
 
In view of the homeless problems in this country, I think a lot of states need to review  the homeless shelters in order to make changes that promote safer environments and consider the wellness issues of the homeless.
 
Everyone who is homeless wants a home.
