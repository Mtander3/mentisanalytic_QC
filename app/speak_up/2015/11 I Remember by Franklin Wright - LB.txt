I Remember
by Franklin Wright in Charlotte, NC

I can remember when my daughter was born on February 12, 1998. She was the most beautiful girl in the world, and I thank God for her with all my heart. I asked God for a little girl, and He gave me what I asked for--my little girl who became a little lady. I love and miss her every day of my life. 

I can remember the first time I changed her dirty diaper. It stunk very badly. I remember when I first took her to church, and she just sat there and looked at me. Praise God. I can remember the first time I told her I loved her and gave her a hug and kiss. I can remember the first time I got really mad at her, but the only thing I could do was love her and not be mad anymore.

I can remember the first time I married her mother, who I now love very much as my friend and sister in Christ. I can remember the day I went to prison and left my daughter here without her dad. Lord God, I’m so sorry I left my little girl outside in this wicked world, all alone by herself with no earthly dad; but I’m so glad you were her Heavenly Father. Lord God, I thank you in Jesus’ name, I can remember all of this I did, and I want to make up for the time I wasted away from my little lady, Christina.
