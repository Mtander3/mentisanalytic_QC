I am now 51 years old, but I’m happy that I made it. I was in a little incident before my birthday. 

I was looking out for a friend. He is an older guy, and he had a home invasion and almost died. I was there when they came in the house. I was a victim too. They came with guns, and I was so scared out of my mind not knowing if I was going to live or die. [I got down on my knees and prayed.] They tried to rob my friend, but he did not have anything to give them, so [they hit him until his head gushed blood.] That left me. They took my money, my phone, my pocketbook with my ID and all my personal things I had in my pocketbook, [but they didn’t hurt me].

This incident was a big setback for me. I was saving money for a place to lay my head. It’s sad, but I thank God I’m here. That was three days before my birthday, so I thank God again that I made it to my 51st birthday. Now, I’m saving for a place again. I know as long as I work hard at it, I will be successful. I will accomplish what I want and need out of life.

I am thankful for waking up every day. I am thankful for my health, a bed to sleep in, and being able to take a bath daily. I am so thankful that I am making money to help my living standard. I am thankful that my mom is still here with me. 

I am looking forward to seeing my mom and spending time with her. I am thankful that she is still here. My brother is doing fine, his name is Jerry Mingo, and he is like my twin. He is losing weight, and that is a good thing. I am hoping for a car. I hope that I get one soon because I really need one. I hope to drive up to New York and see my family.
