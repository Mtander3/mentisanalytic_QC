I Was a Meat Cutter
by Edward Smalls in Charlotte, NC

I was a meat cutter for 35 years and then I, Edward Smalls, became homeless because I got involved with the wrong people and went the wrong way. I went and robbed a bank, and then I went to prison. 

I was in prison for two years. My crime was non-violent, so I got a job meat cutting. A man gave me a job and when I got out of prison, he kept me on for one year. When I stopped working for him, I tried to get a job at Piggly Wiggly, Food Lion, Whole Foods, Fresh Market, and Harris Teeter, but they would not give me a job because of my criminal history. That is how I became homeless.

I came to Charlotte in 2012. It is now 2015, and I am still looking for a job and an apartment or some kind of housing. I canâ€™t get housing because of my criminal history, but I thank God every day that I am here and will keep on looking.

I had some good times in my life. I was married at one time. We had three girls and one boy. My son was killed in 2012; someone shot him. I had a successful life at one time. I had a good job and a good home. The only thing I am sorry about is that I robbed that bank. 

Now that all of that is all over, I just want to help take care of my grandkids, get a good job, and an apartment. I am 63 years old and have worked for 45 years.
