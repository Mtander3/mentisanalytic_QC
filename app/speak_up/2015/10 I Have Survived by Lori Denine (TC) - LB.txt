My skin survived the cold with wool: hat, gloves, blankets, sweater, wool in my boots, socks of wool.

My mind survived by tapping; steady tapping with my two hands. Left, right, left, right, left, right, three minutes to balance my brain.  Left, right, left, right, left, right.

My self survived harsh words. Barely. I ran. I walked. I disappeared from the site and the sight where the body with face with the mouth spoke those harsh words stood.
I have survived.

My entire being, my existence, survived a life-threatening situation.  
I remained calm, staged my departure, kept my composure, held a poker face, spoke good-bye and "Thanks for dinner" gracefully, got in my car and made it to the end of the driveway all the while under a watchful eye. I turned the corner and drove.

My mind, my body, my soul refused, and still refuse, to be victims. Yet through all survival, I endure. I accept the fact that it will someday come to an end; hopefully, my survival energy will be able to rest in peace.
