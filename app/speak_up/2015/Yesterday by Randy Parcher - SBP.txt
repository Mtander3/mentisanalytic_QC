Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow
by Randy Parcher
	
Yesterday, I was your neighbor. Today I’m not seen. Tomorrow is a dream that slips away just a little more each day.
Yesterday, I was a worker, homeowner, and part of the community. Today, I’m lonely in crowds, a ghost upon the street, or seen as a monster to be chased out of town. Tomorrow will bring more pain and regret.
Yesterday, I felt good about both myself and how I feel. Today, I’m sick more and more. Tomorrow--what will tomorrow bring?
Yesterday, I was safe. Today, I’m lost and numb with nowhere to lay my head and cry. Tomorrow is a hope not yet born.
Yesterday belongs to me--the one thing no one can take from me. Today, I may let you see a glimpse, but only a glimpse, of who I really am. Tomorrow--what drives us forward? Is it the will to struggle on or the dream that the future will be better than yesterday and today?
It is hard to think of tomorrow when one is numb just trying to get through today, for tomorrow is far away and just a sweet dread held upon the wings of angels. Tomorrow makes all our yesterdays and todays worth the struggles.
