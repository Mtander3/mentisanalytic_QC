Many people ask me many different questions about being a homeless artist working my trade on the street. What kind of things do I have to contend with that other artists, who have a place to stay, don’t have to worry about? Here I will try to find the words to answer some of the questions.
I have to fight with the cold. If it is too cold, my markers will chill. I keep them as close to my heart and body as possible so that they will not freeze. My body heat keeps them warm. In cooler weather, water from the air we breathe condensates upon everything inside the van and sometimes destroys my work. So, we see that the cold and water are my worst nightmares. Then there is broken glass and where to store my work when I’m done with its creation. Next to the cold and water, broken glass is the worst.
People ask me where I create my art handiwork. How can I find places to work at my achievements? I labor wherever I can find room to toil upon my visions. I work a lot at the library using a table somewhere in the back or on a computer (as some of my art is done in digital form),  at Brew or in winter at night in Safe Harbor. The time in Safe Harbor is when I get a lot of my hand-drawn artwork done. In the warmer months, there are other things to do like sell Speak Up zine.
