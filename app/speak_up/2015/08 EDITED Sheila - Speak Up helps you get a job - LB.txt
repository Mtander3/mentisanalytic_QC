Speak Up Helps You Get a Job

by Sheila Apperson


It is so great that selling Speak Up Magazine can enable a person to become noticed by a potential employer. It happens. It happened to me. 

I was selling my Speak Up Zines around the Common Market when I approached a man to see if he would like to buy one. He said “No” at first; but after he came out from eating lunch, he came up to me and said that he would like to take one after all. He gave me a dollar for it and went to his car. 

A few minutes went by, and he came up to me again and said, “I read your article in the Zine, and I really liked it. I liked the part of your interview that said your fondest childhood memory was living next door to a farm with lots of animals and that you loved to walk through the grapevines in your yard.” 

He told me his name and said he had a business growing hydroponic greens and herbs. He said, “I would like to offer you a job in my company for ten dollars an hour for four hours a day.” I was surprised, so I asked him if he was serious. He was. He wanted me to begin the following Monday. He also said that maybe I could write for his company blog. He gave me his card and told me to call him.

I called him and went to work on Monday. It is a physical job that entails climbing up on ladders to water the plants with a purified water system. There is a variety of different micro-greens and herbs. I mop up excess water on the concrete floors to keep them as dry as possible. I am also in training to learn how to harvest the plants. There is quite a bit to learn. It’s cold in the winter and hot in the summer.

I hope this job is good for me and that I can become a valuable employee. I prayed for a job where I could feel empowerment, self esteem and gratitude. I’m glad to be a part of Speak Up.
