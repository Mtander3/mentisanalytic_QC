What’s New with Me
by Earleen Mingo in Charlotte, NC

Well, this is Earleen again. I am writing about things that have happened since the last time I wrote for the Zine. I have been blessed. I have moved into a condo with a friend, and it is peaceful. Also, I have met a lot of people, and they want to tell their stories about what happened to them. I think that would be great.

I have a lot of clients that buy my magazines, so I am doing better than I was, thanks to Speak Up. I have been blessed, and I hope that I can be better, get better, and live better in due time. I know that I will be successful, and I hope that God blesses me with what I need, not what I want. I pray every day to do better in life, and I will work hard at it so that I can have a normal, comfortable life. 

I hope to have the things that I need to become affordable so that I can have my mom come stay with me. It would be great to spend time with her and to just be happy. I want to thank God that I am alive, clean and eating well daily. That is a blessing, so I thank God for that and I am going to do everything in my power to get better and do better. 

I talked to a lot of homeless vets that have served the country, and the stories that they told me were so sad. How they were not treated right is an example of what is wrong in this world. That is life. I heard a story that the vets are dropped in the wrong areas and that they have to fight their way back just to survive. I think the vets should be helped. That’s just me.
