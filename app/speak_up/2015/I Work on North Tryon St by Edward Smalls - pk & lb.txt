I Work on North Tryon Street 
by Edward Smalls in Charlotte, NC 

I get up every morning at six a.m. I catch the train and go to the intersection of North Tryon Street and 5th Street. I sell Speak Up Magazines. I arrive at eight a.m. and leave at four p.m. 

I am really glad that I started selling Speak Up Magazine. It introduced me to a lot of people on North Tryon Street. They are very kind, sweet and lovely people. They give me donations, something to drink, and buy my lunch. As I get to know them, some give me odds and ends work to do around their houses. That is why I love the people of North Tryon Street. 

I want to thank the people of North Tryon Street for being so kind, caring and loveable. By selling Speak Up Magazine and the people giving me donations and work around their homes, I am the happiest once-homeless person in the world!

I just want to thank the people of North Tryon Street for their kindness.
