Addressing my Address
by Randy Parcher in Traverse City, MI

We have seen a change in how the homeless are seen here in Traverse City--going from ghosts upon the streets, then monsters instilling fear wherever they appear, to finally being seen as people with shortcomings and faults just like anyone else. Still, we see that we must address the question of my address.

We hear people say, “Why don’t they get a job? How can they live that way?” Stop and think about when you were looking for work, spending your day putting in app after app until someone gave you an opening to prove yourself. First, you must get through the door before you can prove yourself. You must address the matter of your address.

How do we make living on the street into something that won’t harm our chances of getting a job? How do we get away from the fact that we live on a park bench or under one of the bridges in town? We may spend time in Safe Harbor or at Goodwill. Our address may be one of the outreach programs or, as in the case of some of the women, a safe house, where they are trying to get away from an abusive and dangerous home life. Each of us must address my address.

Even if we get in the door and work hard, we may not get off the street.  We may find ourselves under-employed and still not be able to get a place to call home, but at least we have hope for change. We may still have to address my address, but now with a little hope for salvation.
