One day, I found myself living as a single person instead of a single parent. I lost the custody of my son, Joshua. Joshua and I had worn out two strollers traveling here and there while enjoying each day. I potty trained him, taught him his colors, numbers, letters and helped him begin to read. I carried him on my shoulders many times. We shared a strong father-and-son bond. His mother had not been all that interested in raising him, and I felt that a child would take away her attention from our relationship. I had been her first husband, but by the time she filed for custody of Joshua, she was on her third marriage. I lost the father-and-son bond that day and desired to no longer have a home. Â It has taken over 30 years to regain that desire for a home again, and I can see it in the near future.
