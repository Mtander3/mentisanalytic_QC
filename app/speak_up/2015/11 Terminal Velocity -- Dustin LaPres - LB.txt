We lived, our lives played out like
 	Comic books...heroes and heroines.
We moved at speeds that some would
  	Say were terminal...a velocity
  	That was our philosophy.
 
We loved and breathed like we were
 	Acrobats--all our imperfections caught.
We floated on the waves of existential thought,
 	Like aeronauts...we had atmospheric buoyancy,
 	Must've been our simplicity...
 
We learned the rules of life like
 	Barristers...well studied and duplicitous.
We went through lovers like we were
 	Cosmonauts...we overcame gravity,
 	And shared ourselves with brevity...
 
We grew old and tearful eyed like
 	Willow trees...aging painfully.
We raced across the universe like we
 	Were shooting stardust warriors,
 	Finally crashing like the ocean surf...
 
We awoke one day, began recovering
 	The satellites of our humanity.
We admitted faults like we were
 	Penitential existents who had finally
 	Come to meet the divinity...
 
We came to love like we were vessels
 	Of Purity....we loved unconditionally...
