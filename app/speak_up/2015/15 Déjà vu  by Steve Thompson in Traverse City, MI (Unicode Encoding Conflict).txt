Déjà vu 
by Steve Thompson in Traverse City, MI

When I was in construction, I was working on putting in a new kitchen and bathroom. Something kind of strong was telling me that I had been at this house before. This feeling went on for quite some time as this was a big job. I got my answer when my boss said if I knew somebody who would want some old cabinets for free. Instantly my younger brother came to mind, and I called him and gave directions. He picked out some items. We loaded his truck. Before he left, I asked him why this place felt familiar. He told me that 10 or 12 years prior, we had worked there for a different boss. Come to find out, we had put a new roof on the house. Case solved.
