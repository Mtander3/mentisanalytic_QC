The best moment of my entire life was when I agreed to marry my ex-husband, John. Why? Because the marriage produced my three beautiful, adult daughters.
One of my daughters was born on April 20, Adolph Hitler’s birthday. Another daughter was born September 11, the day of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City in 2001. The third daughter was born in Freehold, New Jersey.
My daughters’ childhood years were normal. They participated in activities such as band, ice skating, camping and high school/college volleyball championships. They are all college graduates. One even has her Ph.D. We are Catholic. All three daughters had, or will have,  fairy-tale weddings, exquisite affairs at the local country club or at the beach. I expect them to remember their roots and upbringing.
