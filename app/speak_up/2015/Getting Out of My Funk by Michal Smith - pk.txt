Getting Out of My Funk
By Michal Smith in Charlotte, NC

I felt like the prodigal son had come home when I walked through the door at Speak Up. I missed it—the people writing and sharing, the spiritual feng shui of the place.
The last six months have been a multitude of trials and adversities for me. I stepped out of a loveless relationship of convenience, looked for an apartment, and moved into a hotel for a few weeks. The hotel burned down, so I moved back home to help my mother. We both were sick; and I felt like I was right back at square one, homeless again. I felt defeated. My mother told me that I was never homeless, but that I just never came home.
Complications from an accident caused me to be hospitalized with pancreatitis and liver damage, vertigo, and a traumatic brain injury. I now receive SSI, but it is not enough to make it on my own. At the same time, my mother was deathly ill. She passed away on January 30.
My mother was a woman who was revered and loved by many. She was a drug/alcohol counselor for about fourteen years. Her presence is daily missed. I am her oldest son and have to deal with banks and lawyers about my family house which is currently being threatened to be taken away from me.
Through all of that happening, I still find the strength to go on through Jesus, my Lord and Savior. When I think about what is going on around me, I think of what John Legend said, “My head’s underwater but I’m breathing fine.”
Through it all, God has kept me. I tell people that I put Gorilla Glue on my hands and grabbed God’s hand so I wouldn’t let go! After you weather the storm, you must learn to dance in the rain.
That is what has led me back to Speak Up. I miss it, not just the selling but also the fact that I feel a part of something that’s going to help me and somebody else. I like meeting the people, being able to share with them and them with me.
So if you see it, live it, think it, or write it, Speak Up about it!
