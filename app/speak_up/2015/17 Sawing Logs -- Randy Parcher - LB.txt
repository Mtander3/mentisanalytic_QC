They say that the homeless are lazy, but the truth is that we are just tired - mentally, physically, and emotionally. Tired from standing in lines playing the waiting game. Tired from moving around all day and sometimes having to move halfway through the night. 
Some, like us, are lucky to have a van or car to sleep in, but still we have to put up with the lights in the parking lot shining all night long and the sounds of cars as they pass where we park. It must be gotten used to, but it makes sleep difficult. My day starts at 7:45 in the morning and doesn’t end until after eleven, or sometimes later at night, during the spring and summer. 
During the fall and winter when Safe Harbor is running, my day starts at about six in the morning and goes until eleven at night. There we have a different set of sleeping difficulties. For those who have ever slept with or in the same room as someone who snores, wheezes, or breathes heavily, you will know what I mean. The first day at Safe Harbor, we had twenty to thirty men in one room sleeping with a few playing a round robin of “saw the logs.” One would start, then another one, and finally the last one would join in creating an agonizing buzz all night; and as I was not used to the sounds, it made it hard to get any sleep. 
The homeless aren’t lazy—we are just tired mentally, physically, emotionally. We need a good full night’s sleep and some sweet dreams.
