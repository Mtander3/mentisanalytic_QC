When you speak to a person who is homeless, approach them with genuine compassion and respect--with agape love, embracing a Christ-like character.

Be a good listener. 
A humble attitude is a must. 
Be a friend. 
Stay away from the solution-solving mode while they figure it out for themselves.
Never tell them what they need to do. 
Ask for permission to share your story. 
Keep it simple. 
Empower, encourage, motivate them to have the courage to be themselves. 
Do it for Jesus.
