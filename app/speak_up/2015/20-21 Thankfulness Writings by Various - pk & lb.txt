I am thankful for God giving me good health. I am thankful for Speak Up Magazine because it keeps me housed and fed, and I meet a lot of good people every day.

I want to thank the people of North Tryon Street for being so kind, caring and loveable. By selling Speak Up Magazine and the people giving me donations and work around their homes, I am the happiest once-homeless person in the world!

I am thankful for...living life on God’s terms rather than the terms of men. I am thankful to know that God is in charge and large in my life, supernaturally supplying all of my needs according to His will. To God be the glory.

I am thankful for...waking up every day. I am thankful for my health, a bed to sleep in, being able to take a bath daily. I am so thankful that I am making money to help my living standard. I am thankful that my mom is still here with me.

If I could think of words to express how I feel, I would. Right now, I am getting tongue tied. So I will wish you all an ebullient measure of good will. Seriously, I’m very grateful to have a chance to say...Thanks (to the people at Goodwill Inn).

Speak Up magazine has really helped me a lot to use my voice and to tell my stories. ...It has been a lot of fun. I feel so good afterwards too. It has really made me feel like a totally different person. I feel more alive and vibrant compared to what I was feeling like before.

People’s kindnesses are what inspire me, and emulating that kindness keeps me on track, especially where patience is concerned.

Be kind. Be respectful of everyone you meet. Try to make someone smile.
