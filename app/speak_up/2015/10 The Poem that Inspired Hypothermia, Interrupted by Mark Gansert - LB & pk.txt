It rained for ten straight hours.
There was no shelter.
It was forty-nine degrees by 3 a.m.
A mass of desperate souls were on the sidewalk outside the City Center 
where the HVAC system vents heated air into the street. 

We were all wet and cold.
We were all tired and miserable.
Some of us were drunk.
Most of us were sane. 
All of us were homeless.
