Beat the Pavement
by Jennifer Milton

The library opens at 10.
Um ba bump, bump
Beat the pavement.
Scents of hot dogs, Chinese food, and Philly cheesesteaks 
Wet and crusty at the same time. 
Ba bump, bump
Beat the pavement.

Hail to the victorious goddess Nike.
She blesses me.
Who knew rubber soles could be my salvation?
Um ba bump, bump
Beat the pavement.

Three french fry boxes high.
Um ba bump, bump
Beat the pavement.
Winter storm warning, 
Who stole my pink gloves?
Curse this cold hard ground.
Ba bump, bump
Beat the pavement.

A moan in the night
Interrupting dreams of grandeur.
Nessa stop your wailing.
Joy cometh in the morning,
Um ba bump, bump
Beat the pavement.
Three deep breaths and oblivion.
Ba bump, bump
Beat the pavement.

The library opens at 10.
Um ba bump, bump
Beat the pavement.
Scents of hot dogs, Chinese food and Philly cheesesteaks
Wet and crusty at the same time.
Ba bump, bump
Beat the pavement.
