Dear Politician,

I am homeless. I have been homeless for many years following a protracted illness, and having no visible means of support wound up sleeping in my car--when I owned one. Currently, I sleep in a shelter with 200 other men. However, I have, out of necessity, slept in cardboard boxes, under highway overpasses, and just passed out in a park somewhere.

It's not always bad, mind you. Sometimes it fun to be laughed at, to have people throw things from cars at you, to listen to jeers and insults yelled at you. It's almost like being in public office. After all, if you've no place to live but in the public eye, we're kindred spirits.

Say, that gives me an idea. If I could get every single homeless person to sit in their elected officials’ offices all across this country, maybe you might get the point. If you've ever smelled the epically, chronically homeless, you'd try to do something to alleviate the problem (or at least pour a bottle of cologne on them).

We are not all crazy, or druggies, or drunks, or shiftless. A lot of us just don't have families to rely on, which is the most basic social support system. I'm sorry to inform you that the Social Security Administration does nothing to alleviate the social situation of homelessness.

In a country where over 50 percent of the people hold no assets and so many millions are on the Federal threshold for being in poverty, something needs to change. Unfortunately your record of meaningful change isn’t very promising. Promises, bravado and hot air from your distant seat of kingly power are pretty much a joke to those of us on the streets. I challenge you to pause the choir-pleasing bluster and spend a day on the streets — give us your ear, we’ll give you ours.

Sincerely,

Some homeless guy
