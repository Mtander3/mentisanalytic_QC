Waiting for night to come

The old man quietly sits upon the bench hardly moving except to reach into a bag of bread to throw to the birds noisily gathered at his feet. Each movement sends the pain of oldness though his body and his hands carry the signs of age weathered by the things they have done. They have held life’s first and last breath, love’s hope and night’s loss. Now they wait for night to come. 

He is dressed in his best clothes that in his youth fit him like a glove but now are loose and baggy upon his ancient weathered frame. Once the finest that he owned, now antiquated, in disrepair, faded and worn as he is…lost in dreams of the past. Still he moves slowly as he feeds the noisy birds and speculates of the night to come.

 	His hair that was black as coal now white as snow, nevertheless, wild and defiant of time’s passage waving in the gentle breeze. His face a map of his life, lined with loss and woe, joy and faith.  His eyes hidden by the shadows created by the hat perched on his head as he sits silently waiting, the only sound the hushed clattering of the birds like mourners at a funeral waiting for the eulogy to be read, one last farewell. Yet he ponders what comes next. Will there be no more pain after the night at last comes?
