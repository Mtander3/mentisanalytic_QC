The bank sign on South Tryon read 42° at 3:36 a.m. It had been raining all night. I was soaked to the bone and suffering the beginning stages of hypothermia. I sat with arms pulled into my not-so-waterproof jacket in a kind of heat-escape-lessening posture. I desperately needed to strip naked and get dry clothes on. Unfortunately, that wasn’t happening at a bus stop on South Tryon in the center of Uptown.

Also present at the bus stop was a man who was wildly intoxicated on, curiously enough, generic Listerine mouthwash--the obvious choice of the mildly belligerent and hopeless alcoholic who was too drunk to notice that his lips were blue, his teeth were chattering, and he needed dry clothes as much as I did.

As the rain tapered off near 4 am, I wandered freezing toward City Center and to the bus depot which would be opening soon. As I passed the first set of stairs on College, a warm blast of air flooded the sidewalk. It felt incredible. The air handlers from the condensing side of the building’s heat exchanger flooded its precious heat onto the street.

I stood there in the very dry, warm, fast-moving air and was simultaneously dried off and warmed in what could only be described as a giant hand dryer from a public restroom. I sat there with three other homeless men also soaking wet and trying to get warm on a public sidewalk when an overbearing, pompous, and plain-mean security guard threatened us with police action if we didn’t move along. At 4:25 in the morning, it seemed sadistic of him. I had a mind to invite him to call the cops. However, it was best just to go.

If you read this, and it’s raining and cold outside in Charlotte, just know that there are men and women who can’t get into the shelters. They could be elderly or infirm, and that could spell their demise.
