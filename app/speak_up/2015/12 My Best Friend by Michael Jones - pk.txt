I have a life-long friend who owns a business in Wilson, NC. He has been the best friend/big brother/role model that I never had when I was growing up. I met Van when I was 18 and in jail. He was a bail bondsman, and he would come in and out of the jail all day. I would ask him for reading material, and he would give it to me. I think he saw potential in me because he noticed how fast I was reading the newspapers and magazines. 

On the night of Christmas Eve, the jailor opened my door and told me to get dressed because I was leaving. I had no idea how this was happening because I didn’t have any family or friends who would help me. When i came out of the jail, Van was waiting for me. I got in his car, and he asked me where my home was. I told him I didn’t have one. He took me to his house and has been my best friend for the last 11 years. 

Van has saved and helped me in so many situations, and not just financially. He introduced me to his family, friends, and they all accept me like I am family. Without Van, I would probably be dead or in prison right now.
