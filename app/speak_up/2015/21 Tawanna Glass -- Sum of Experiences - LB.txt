The other day, I was having a deep, uncensored conversation with a few other people. We were sharing our life experiences, and my sister-in-law looked at me and said, “They say that people are the sum of their experiences. I would like to sit with you and hear your story—all of the details.”
She said that I seem to have myself all figured out even though, to me, my life is in shambles. I don’t show it. I always have a smile on my face, am cheerful and in good spirits. I am also helpful. The only reason that I could give her is that the Lord is by my side.
I believe with God by my side, everything is a blessing.
I always have a positive attitude and help people when I have the opportunity.
Being able to share my life with other people wouldn’t be possible without God by my side.
Blessed.
