The Gouge

     It was a beautiful summer day as I woke up to the sound of water flowing in the creek, the birds were singing to me on one of many arms. Then all of a sudden there was the banging of the water pump being primed by a little girl trying to collect water for the dishes to be done.  Then all of a sudden there came this truck pulling in the driveway in front of me, a lot of talking and funny noises like something banging on something hard like nails into wood. I heard the starting of an engine, people saying their goodbyes, doors shutting, and then I felt a ripping feeling.
      Nobody noticed it except for this elderly lady walking down the long driveway. She saw what had happened to me and started crying and feeling really sad that I had this big gouge in the base of my trunk. She picked up my piece of torn bark and wrapped it to my lower trunk of the tree. This made me feel so much better. I knew I would be on a quick mend. Then this downy woodpecker decided to start pecking on my upper body of the tree, thinking it was going to find something to eat, of all things, after my tragic experience this morning.
     It was two weeks later. The man of the house came and took the bandage off my trunk and, to his surprise, my bark had amazingly grafted back to me. I was good as new--it was a miracle. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, water from the red hand pump running--this is what a summer day on McCullum Lake is all about. The best memories of the summer ever are seeing the kids catching crayfish in the creek to use for fishing bait.
