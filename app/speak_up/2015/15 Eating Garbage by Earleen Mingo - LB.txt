Eating Garbage
By Earleen Mingo in Charlotte, NC

On one of my working days, I was selling my Speak Up magazines. What I saw on that day was amazing. I saw a homeless guy eating out of the garbage can! I had to stop and really look. I said to myself, am I really seeing this? I’ve heard about people eating out of the trash, but to actually see it was so sad. When he was looking in the trash can, I thought to myself that this guy is really hungry. Before I could say anything to him, he found some food and was sitting down eating. When he found it, he was smiling like he was so happy to have found the food. It was some salad/half sandwich, and he sat down and was eating like he had not eaten in awhile. 

I sold a magazine, and when I looked up, he was gone. I said to myself, I wish I could catch him. I could have maybe given him a job with Speak Up, but he had left. One day, I hope I see him again. I will not forget him because of what he was wearing. He had on a lot of clothes. It was not cold--it was pretty warm--and he had on two coats, two pants, a hat, and boots. They were really dirty, so I know he was homeless--looked like he had not taken a bath in a while; but that’s okay. God will be with him, and I pray for him that he will be blessed.
