Love in a Pot

by Sheila Apperson



There are so many memories of friends and family in a pot. Everyone needs a pot.

I knew this lady who had become homeless and lost everything; however, she was determined to keep her pots. She asked three different friends to keep each of her three pots. As time went by, the lady finally found a home. She went to each friend to retrieve her pots, and each one said they did not know where they were. She told them that it really hurt because there is so much love in her pots.

Later on, the woman returned to visit each of her friends. When they were not looking, she took her pots back one at a time. One day, she called all three friends and invited them over for dinner. She had a wonderful dinner prepared in all three pots. As they sat at her table and noticed her pots, she could see how surprised they looked. She looked at them and said, “There is so much love in my pots.”


Love is in all the pots
In the world swirling
Spurling with love
Something good, something shared
Something thoughtfully prepared
Something hot hitting the spot
Love is always in a pot.
