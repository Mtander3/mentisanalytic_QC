Spring 
by Fred Corfet in Traverse City, MI

Spring! No, really, it actually did arrive. No more snow. The car somehow made it through another winter with only a few days of risking frostbite on my hands and feet from fixing it in the winter. Time to take on some of the deferred maintenance: change the oil, replace the brake pad, and change the power steering pump that made the care smoke like it was on fire for the last year. Hopefully, I’ll also change the ball joints that make my front wheels pop and crack like my broken neck. . .

Time for spring cleaning--meaning there’s good stuff to pick up in alleys and dumpsters, and hopefully a chance to make a few bucks needed to buy those car parts that were not generously provided by the dumpsters.

And this spring is special. It’s my ex-wife’s last chance to make sure I’m permanently homeless. The foreclosed home must be vacated by July, and the judge ruled that my ex must sell me her share of the house that was paid for, but she’s not complying. The contempt hearing was postponed until after summer begins, so the court order is basically useless. So this spring I’ll be losing my home of 15 years, permanently this time.

So I better get that car fixed. Whether or not I can move, it will have to work really hard this spring.
