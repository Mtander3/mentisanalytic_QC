I am thankful for God giving me good health.
I am thankful for Speak Up Magazine because it keeps me housed and fed, 
and I meet a lot of good people every day. 

I am looking forward to getting another job and apartment.
I am looking forward to having a better life than I did in the past. 
I had a very bad time in my past. Speak Up inspires me very much.

I am hoping for a job and housing that I will never lose,
and that I will live happy and prosperous for the rest of my life.
