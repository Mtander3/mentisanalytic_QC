Finding a Place
by Vanessa Keith in Charlotte, NC


I came from LA to Charlotte ten years ago. I wanted to have a place for my family. I came here with two children, a boy and a girl. My new husband invited me to live with him in a new home. He promised he would take care of us. For the moment, I thought the he wanted a family. But, come to find out, that was not what he had in mind. He was just using us. It all ended up in a divorce!

After we left him and the house, that was it! I moved into another house across the street. The children became out of control. My daughter was talking back and my son was also. It was hard trying to raise the kids alone. Things got worse with my daughter, and I called out for help. My kids ended up in child custody!

I lost my house and almost my mind. I became very low income. On top of that, my family was gone, and my mother died just before I lost my kids and my home. Where do I turn before and after the rain falls? Well, nine years later, I’ve had to downsize to living with people renting [their] rooms. What do I do now? My hands just hold on to God’s hands. Forward I go. 

I just don’t want to end up on the streets again, like last winter, carrying my bags. I just want my family and a home again. Please, help me, Lord!
