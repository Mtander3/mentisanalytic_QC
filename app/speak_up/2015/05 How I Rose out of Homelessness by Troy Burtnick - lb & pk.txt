There are many facets to the particular question of how I rose out of homelessness. First and foremost, and by far the biggest of these facets was me, myself, and I. 

Without the want and the drive to better myself and my conditions, I would still be there today. It takes courage, strength, determination, and humility to rise above this plight in society. I had that and more. So have many others I’ve seen who have risen above and succeeded where so many fail. I’m not tooting my own horn or theirs for that matter. I’m simply stating a fact that, fortunately, I can be proud of. Without me, myself, and I, this journey would have never started, and my road would continue to be dark and cold. 

It wasn’t me alone though, Without the beating heart of Charlotte NC that cares so deeply for this travesty of society, I might still be there no matter how hard I tried. It is the work of the churches that feed throughout the week with loving words of encouragement, the city morgue opening their doors to us almost every day of the week, King's Kitchen and Jim Noble being a constant source of love and encouragement, and the First United Methodist Church opening its doors every Sunday morning for food, coffee, fellowship, and encouragement. Let’s not forget the burrito people on their bikes handing out awesome breakfast burritos and Capri Suns to the group who feeds on Tuesdays (that everyone affectionately calls “the beans and rice people”). There's Urban Ministries that does so much for the homeless and the community around them that it is staggering. The Crisis Center’s Room at the Inn...I think you get the picture although I could fill pages with how many groups, organizations and churches are out there fighting the fight. All of this, and so much more, make up this rough diamond of how I rose above homelessness. 

We cannot forget the second biggest factor in my success and that is, of course, my new-found home and family at Speak Up Magazine.
