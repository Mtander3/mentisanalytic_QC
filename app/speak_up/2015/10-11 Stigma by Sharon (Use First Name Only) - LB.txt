Stigma
by Sharon in Traverse City, MI 

According to Webster’s
Seventh “New” Dictionary
From Massachusetts
Nineteen seventy one:

“Stigma
Archaic:
A sear left
By a hot iron
Brand…mark of shame…discredit.  A stain.
An identifying mark.”

Stigma
According to Us
A label…grenade.
We play “hot potato”
Separating limbs…our body…unable to function.

In the grip of our attitudes
Lying in wait.
We are unaware.
Help me say “Yes, I see it. My prejudice. I did that.”
Own it…Suffer…Drop it…Feel vulnerable.
Learn.
The hot iron cools, leave it to rust. Walk away.
We do have a choice.
