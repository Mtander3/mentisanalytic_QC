Good Memories

Good memories:

Circle gathering with Farmers Market friends

In the summer of 2014, I went to the Farmers Market fundraiser for the organic farmers at Windy Hill Farm. The event was sold out. Dilworth Billiards Bar and Grill Restaurant gets their salads and grass-fed beef steaks from Windy Hill Farm. There was a raffle ticket drawing. All my co-workers were there.

Good times at lunch with my friend, Sarah Bowman, Gospel Singer

I had lunch with my friend, Sarah Bowen. We went to the Asian-style buffet called Ichiban on Albemarle Road. She told me a lot of her personal life stories. She is a Christian Gospel singer. She and her other musicians composed a new CD recently. She gave it to me as a present.

When I received Christmas presents from church

It felt good when I received Christmas presents from my church. This past Christmas, my friends from church gave me a lot of surprise Christmas presents. They gave me a sweater and scarf, bath scrub, money, and other things. This is an important memory for me because it makes me feel special.

Good times having coffee with Sally Wright

I had coffee time with my friend, Sally Wright. I am very excited because she told me she is getting married. We met at a breakfast restaurant named Toast in the Dilworth area. She got a new job as a youth ministry pastor.
