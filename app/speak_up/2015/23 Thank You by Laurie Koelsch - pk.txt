Thank You
by Laurie Koelsch in Traverse City, MI

As we gather around the table for our last meal in Safe Harbor, I think back to this last year, to the friends we have lost and the friends we have made at Safe Harbor. Some of these friendships have lasted through the years and some just in passing.
Some volunteers leave a lasting impression and some we're just happy they are there giving us a warm place to sleep and a hot meal. There are those who give us a listening ear to hear our stories about our days. Some of them make sure we have enough warm clothing. If needed, they bring us clothing. They take time off their busy schedules and repair zippers on clothing, backpacks or coats.
In this cold world, these little touches of kindness mean more to us than we can express. Many give not just their time but their loving spirits, sometimes taking away as much as they give.
We would like to thank all the pastors for taking the time to open their doors to us, and thank the people we donâ€™t see behind the scenes who give us these warm places to sleep and a hot meal to eat.  We really appreciate all you have done to make this happen.
So to all the volunteers who have enriched our lives, we give a hearty and heartfelt thank you and a wish that all your years are filled with love.
